# Front-End-Vimer

> Some setting about Vim or MacVim

## Getting start

  Beause we want to use the plugin: [neocomplete](https://github.com/Shougo/neocomplete.vim) (More fast).

  We should install [MacVim with if\_lua](https://github.com/zhaocai/macvim),

  and you can install it with [homebrew](http://brew.sh/):
```
// If you don't install homebrew on mac
// you can paste that at Terminal

ruby -e "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/master/install)"

// Install macvim with lua by using homebrew

brew install macvim --with-cscope --with-lua --HEAD
```
